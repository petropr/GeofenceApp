# GeofenceApp

 Η ομάδα σας καλείται να αναπτύξει μια εφαρμογή Android καταγραφής δραστηριότητας εισόδου-παραμονής-εξόδου σε συγκεκριμένες 
 γεωγραφικές περιοχές. Βάσει αυτών θα παράγονται και τα αντίστοιχα στατιστικά στοιχεία. Geofencing
 combines awareness of the user's current location with awareness of nearby features, defined as the user's proximity to 
 locations that may be of interest. To mark a location of interest, you specify its latitude and longitude. 
 To adjust the proximity for the location, you add a radius. The latitude, longitude, and radius define a geofence. 
 You can have multiple active geofences at one time.  Location Services treats a geofences as an area rather than as a 
 points and proximity. This allows it to detect when the user enters or exits a geofence. For each geofence, you can ask 
 Location Services to send you entrance events or exit events or both. You can also limit the duration of a geofence by 
 specifying an expiration duration in milliseconds. After the geofence expires, Location Services automatically removes it.
